       1 * xnumon-stats     agent metrics for in-band health monitoring
       2 * image-exec       a process executed an executable image
       3 * process-access   a process has accessed another process using
                            task_for_pid or ptrace
       4   launchd-add      a process has added or modified a Launch Agent or
                            Launch Daemon plist; incurs file close audit load
       The agent will only monitor the audit events that are needed to produce
       the selected events.  Disabling events that use hotter audit events is
       one way to reduce load.  The events marked with * are recommended to
       keep enabled, disabling them does not result in a significant reduction
       of load.

                    any delay, but acquisition of images may fail for processes
                    writing to or unlinking their executable image on disk,
                    resulting in log events without hashes or codesign info.
       1 open       Synchroniously open and stat executable image before the
                    process is allowed to execute in the new image.
                    This incurs only a minimal delay before the new process may
                    execute, but processes writing to their own exec image may
                    cause subsequent hashes and codesign acquisition to fail,
                    resulting in log events without hashes or codesign info.
                    Processes unlinking but not modifying their own executable
                    image on disk will have hashes acquired successfully.
       2 hashes     Synchroniously acquire hashes of the executable image
                    before the process is allowed to execute in the new image.
                    Incurs a delay of a few milliseconds depending on image
                    size, but ensures we have hashes for all exec images.  For
                    processes modifying or unlinking their own image on disk,
                    the subsequent acquisition of codesign information may
                    fail, resulting in log events without codesign info.
                    The delay for hash acquisition is minimal if hashes for the
                    same binary have been cached from a previous execution.
       3 codesign   Synchroniously acquire hashes and code signature info
                    before the process is allowed to execute in the new image.
                    Incurs a significant delay of tens of milliseconds even for
                    very small executable images, but ensures we have both
                    hashes and code signature information for all executed
                    image files.  The delay for hash and code signature info
                    acquisition is minimal if hashes and code signature info
                    for the same binary have been cached from a previous
                    execution.

       called exec, but have not been logged by xnumon yet.  Additionally, upon
       starting xnumon, all currently running processes will be added to the
       queue at once.  The default should be sufficient for all configurations,
